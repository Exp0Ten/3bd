# 3bd
This is a project of making a user friendly debugger from scratch.
The name 3bd is an acronym for Three Body Debugger. I had an inspiration from the three body problem in mathematics/physics.
I also wish to somehow reflect that in the UI feel, however that is a secondary objective.
My main inspiration was that I have seen very little user friendly debuggers or commercial software in general. I understand that most of these tools have a simple UI to make them version compatible, however I have been very displeased with the look of most of these apps.

I have played many puzzle games with programming aspects and loved the UI that was used for debugging or visualizing the software, and was very disappointed to find that commercial software lacks some basic theming options.
I wish to therefore make it customizable enough and give the user the control over how they use the software. In the end, its just a piece of code running complex algorithms and it'd be sad someone chose to not use the tools just because of the outlook of the software.
